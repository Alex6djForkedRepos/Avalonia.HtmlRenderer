# Avalonia.HtmlRenderer

Avalonia port of the https://github.com/ArthurHub/HTML-Renderer project.
Fully managed implementation of HTML engine.

Note, this library doesn't replace WebView/WebBrowser controls, as its capabilities are limited.
Many modern HTML features are not supported.

For samples, see Demo project.
